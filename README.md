# Top_words_analysis
It picks top seven words that often used on the website given by the user.
I used request and BeautifulSoup library to parse text from any website. Later which used for word extraction
I used few NLP libraries like nltk to use stopwords and remove it from the text to filter it out along with string functions to remove punctuations as well.
Afterwards, count the words frequency and store it in a dictionary.
With the help of matplotlib, I present those words as a bar graph that a user can see and save it in their system if they want.
Overall, this project helps one to figure out what any particular website is emphasizing the most without even looking into it.
